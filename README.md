Dice Game with DOM: Try your luck with this engaging Dice Game powered by the Document Object Model (DOM). It's a two-player game where each player rolls a virtual die, and the player with the higher roll emerges as the victor. The game begins by generating random numbers for both players, displaying corresponding dice images to simulate the excitement of a real dice roll.

Player 1's result is shown in the first image, while Player 2's outcome appears in the second image. The game dynamically updates a header to declare the winner, be it Player 1, Player 2, or a draw if the numbers match.
